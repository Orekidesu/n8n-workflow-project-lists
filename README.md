## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is part of my journey to become an **AI automation specialist**. I’m documenting and sharing everything I build—from agent orchestration to social media analytics—to help others learn and to showcase what’s possible with n8n + AI.

Big thanks to **Nate** for sparking many of these ideas and pushing me to think modular and scalable.
